Hello, my friends, and  my haters, as well.  Glad you're here,  it's  my channel "Art-Raid"/*suckers*/. I'm Dark Sun and now we are going to listen and admire the best soundtracks I've ever heard in anime and the best anime which you love cause of its sound. 

Now its TOP 10:

the 10'th is : Gurenge from Demon Slayer
Its the opening of the first season of Deamon Slayer. This song is for ever in my heart. Young heroes, brother and sister, have lost their family in childhood (I hope you have not)
